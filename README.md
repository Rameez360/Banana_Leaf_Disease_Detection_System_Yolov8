# Banana Leaf Disease Detection using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting and classifying banana leaf diseases using **YOLOv8** â€” a real-time object detection model. The goal is to assist farmers by automating early disease detection for better crop management.

---

## Project Overview

Banana plants are prone to several diseases that affect both yield and quality. This project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to automate the identification of leaf diseases from images, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

## Diseases Detected

The model is trained to detect the following banana leaf diseases:

- Cordana
- Sigatoka
- Pestalotiopsis
- Fusarium
